# About the Project: Password Manager
In this Python script, I've created a simple yet functional password manager using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The program allows users to generate strong passwords, save login details (website, email, and password), and search for stored information. The password generation utilizes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols for enhanced security. The data is stored in a JSON file, and the application provides feedback messages to the user, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience. The intuitive GUI design makes it easy for users to add, search, and manage their passwords effectively.
